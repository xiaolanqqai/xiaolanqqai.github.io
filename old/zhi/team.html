			<span class="tea-text5"><b>Story of tevaplanter.</b></span>
			<span class="my-3">Time escapes us in the fast paced world of today. We often focus on the end result and not the process… eager to taste the fruits of life while missing out on the joy of the journey itself. </span>
			<span class="mb-3">Our initial obstacle was the development process of the product. We needed to slow down the pace of working in order to see and focus on details that needed to be worked, re-worked, re-designed,  tested, and iterated. Once we came to a working solution we moved to the next challenge which involved the plants. Here we needed to slow down even more and enter the time-scale of plants, waiting days and sometimes weeks to see if it grows, how it will grow, what grows, what doesn’t, and why. Bringing us back to the drawing board time and again. </span>
			<span class="mb-3">There is a sense of patience that develops when you enter the time-scale of plants. There is beauty that we came to see in every process of the plants' life. At first, to us they looked stuck in time, immobile. But photographing them this past year, every couple of minutes, revealed the magic of the natural process that plants go through. They’re constantly in motion; dancing.</span>
			<span class="mb-3">The tevaplanter has a very visible timeline as you can see the process of plant growth on the surface - from seeds sprouting to roots grasping and growing looking for water, leaves extending towards the light, and flowers blooming. </span>
			<span class="mb-3">The process itself is the reward. We hope you will enjoy every moment of growing your tevaplanter. </span>
