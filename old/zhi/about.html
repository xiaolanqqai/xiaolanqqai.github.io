				<span class="mt-2">Current Status: Setting up Mass Production</span>
				<span class="my-5"> Successfully funded on Kicsktarter on July 20, 2020 with over 55K
					Backers!</span>
				<span class=""><b>So why is delivery set to Q2 2023? </b></span>
				<span class="my-3">
					We are on the ground at the factories with the production team to ensure everything runs smoothly
					<br>
					and the output matches the product we’ve worked so hard to develop. We continue to be unwavering
					<br>
					in our demands from production partners. Every single tevaplanter produced is to be as perfect as
					<br>
					the ones in our studio. We will not compromise.
				</span>
				<span class="mb-3">
					With manufacturing being our top priority, we are also working on other aspects of the project
					<br>
					to bring you a truly amazing experience. We want to make sure all of our supporters have the
					<br>
					necessary tools and knowledge for growing healthy and flourishing plants at home on their
					<br>
					tevaplanter, which is why we created a beautiful and comprehensive growing guide which
					<br>
					will be included with each tevaplanter.

				<li class="te-ab-li text-center d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
					<span class="te-ab-li-1 w-100">What kinds of plants can I grow?</span>
					<span class="te-ab-li-2 mb-3" style="display: none;">The tevaplanter is suitable for thousands of different types of plants. Many of the houseplants that come in a pot will grow well on a terrplanter. The plants that grow naturally in the jungle, rainforest, or near a water source are best suited for the tevaplanter. Some examples include types of: orchids, ferns, begonias, hoyas, moss, carnivorous plants, dischidia and more. Each example given is a family which consists of thousands of types of species. Each tevaplanter will come with a guide that will include more information about matching plant types and care instructions.</span>
				</li>
				<li class="te-ab-li text-center d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
					<span class="te-ab-li-1 w-100">Where can I get seeds and/or plants?</span>
					<span class="te-ab-li-2 mb-3" style="display: none;">You can get several types of seeds like buckwheat, sinapis, flax, watercress, chia etc. at your local health food store. Plants, grass seeds, and other types of seeds can be found at your local plant nursery. Although both seeds and plants can also be purchased online. We also plan to provide a list of our recommendations soon.</span>
				</li>
				<li class="te-ab-li text-center d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
					<span class="te-ab-li-1 w-100">Is it possible to grow herbs?</span>
					<span class="te-ab-li-2 mb-3" style="display: none;">Most herbs are plants that grow large and need deep roots in the ground. Therefore, although some herbs can grow on the tevaplanter they are not the ideal solution for them. Edible seeds of plants which are commonly used for sprouting (ie, chia, buckwheat, sinapis, flax, watercress) can sprout and grow on the tevaplanter for several weeks.</span>
				</li>
				<li class="te-ab-li text-center d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
					<span class="te-ab-li-1 w-100">How do plants get their nutrients or fertilizer?</span>
					<span class="te-ab-li-2 mb-3" style="display: none;">The appropriate nutrients or fertilizer can be dissolved in water and sprayed directly onto the plant roots which are visible on the exterior surface of the tevaplanter. Each tevaplanter will come with a guide that will include more information and care instructions.</span>
				</li>
				<li class="te-ab-li text-center d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
					<span class="te-ab-li-1 w-100">Can I use normal tap water?</span>
					<span class="te-ab-li-2 mb-3" style="display: none;">In most cases, yes. However, if there is an issue with the quality of the water in your area or if the water contains a lot of limestone (calcium) then we suggest filtering the water before using it with the tevaplanter. Besides filtering the water, there are other simple solutions that we have tested to get suitable water, including; collecting rainwater or A/C water or simply using distilled water.</span>
				</li>
				<li class="te-ab-li text-center d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
					<span class="te-ab-li-1 w-100">How often do I need to add water?</span>
					<span class="te-ab-li-2 mb-3" style="display: none;">The tevaplanter acts as a water bank for the plant - slowly releasing water from the interior cavity through the walls to the plant roots on the exterior surface. The rate of perspiration and evaporation is dependent on the temperature and humidity levels in the room. Our estimated range is around 5-15 days. To see when you need to add water, simply lift the lid and peek into the tevaplanter. Each tevaplanter will come with a guide that will include more information and care instructions.</span>
